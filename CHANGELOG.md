# Changelog

## v0.2.0 — 2026-09-22

Renamed to **gram**: the module is `github.com/kjkrol/gram`, the root package `gram` (`gram.Run`).
Plugin resource names (`gram.world`, `gram.collision`, ...) follow, so saves written by gokebiten
do not load. The API below is what settled since v0.1.1.

**Game**
- Stages and Scenes: a `game.Game` is a named set of `game.Stage` values, each with its own ECS
  built when entered, and each Stage a set of `game.Scene`s with a live `Composition` saying what
  is shown and which Scene takes input. `game.Runtime` is one interface for pause, quit, switching
  Stage, persistence and the camera.
- A launcher: `gram.Run(game)`.
- Persistence: resources matched by name; `PostLoader` and `Restorer` hooks.

**Plugins**
- `plugin.Plugin` is the one extension point; behaviors (`plugin.Between`, `plugin.Each`) are
  registered on the plugin that hosts them and refused elsewhere.
- `plugins/world`: config moved into the plugin (`ctx.UseWorld`); edge rules per axis; `OnExit`
  and `Tracked`; `Attach`, `Detach`, `Declare`; the entity renderer with appearance modifiers.
- `plugins/world/kind`: kinds defined from a `Spec` of `Const` and `Load` components; `Seed` and
  `Populate`.
- `plugins/collision`: `Collider` and `Physics`, `ShapeTest`, `Meeting` and `Struck` behaviors,
  ready-made `CountContacts`, `ShowHits`, `LogContacts`.
- `plugins/vision`: `Sight` cones scanned each tick into `Seen`, `Sighting` behaviors, drawn
  outlines; ready-made `Flee` and `Chase`.
- `plugins/board`: single-occupancy fix. `camera`: a root package with zoom limits.
- Clean architecture: `game`, `plugin` and `render` public; only `internal/engine` internal.
- On aabbworld v1.5.0: collisions through `collide.Engine`.

**Project**
- Every package has a `doc.go`; the root one carries the concepts, the tick lifecycle and the
  package graph. README rewritten, with `examples/minimal` as its example.
- All benchmarks in `bench/`; `Makefile` with `bench` and `bench-save`; results and method in
  `BENCHMARKS.md`.

## v0.1.1

Resources reorganised, camera improvements, internal logic hidden behind a public API.

## v0.1.0
